Radial Basis Function node for Maya 2016.

Load the py file into the Script Editor and run. This is a silly way to launch the UI and will be fixed soon :/

Select a pose object in the viewport and click "load pose" in the UI. Select target object(s) in the viewport and click "load targets" in the UI. Check/uncheck connection options and click "build RBF node."

Spheres are built for visualization only and are not necessary for the node to work.
